You need to use a PS4 controller and DS4Windows in order to test play.
There are no up and down attacks right now.

Control:
Square button: Focus on enemy

L2: Focus on left enemy (while focusing)

R2: Focus on right enemy (while focusing)

Circle button: Roll

Left Stick: Movement

Right Stick: Attack (while focusing) or Rotate Camera (while not focusing)

Pressing L1 button and use right stick: Guard


Even though the guard animation looks the same, the game logic is not.
If you guard 2 times, the enemy will stun for 3 seconds and the damage it receives will be 50% larger.
