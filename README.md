You need to use a PS4 controller and DS4Windows in order to test play.
There are no up and down attacks right now.

Control:
Square button: Focus on enemy
Circle button: Roll
Left Stick: Movement
Right Stick: Attack
Pressing L2 button and use right stick: Guard
Even though the guard animation looks the same, the game logic is not.
